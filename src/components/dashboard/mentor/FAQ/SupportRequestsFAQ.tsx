            <p>
                As we continue to grow our programs we are building tools to make our work easier and more efficient. 
                In 2025 we will be introducing the new features to the Foresight Advisor Portal that will allow you to view support requests, company status, and other information to help increase your engagement with Foresight programs. 
                Keep an eye out for updates as we will be rolling them out over the coming months.
